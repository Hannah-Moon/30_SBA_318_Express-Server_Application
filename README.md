<h5 align="left">
My journey as a professional software engineer taught me that technical skills are just one piece of the puzzle. To prepare for upcoming job interviews, I created Interviviing, tailored to my shared experiences with my friends. Interviviing would help me and my friends prepare for the tough interview questions. I hope that I will tackle interviews confidently.
