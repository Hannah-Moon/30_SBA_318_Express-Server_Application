  Interviviing: From Tech Skills to Interview Brilliance!
</h3>
<h5>
My journey as a professional software engineer taught me that technical skills are just one piece of the puzzle. To prepare for upcoming job interviews, I created Interviviing, tailored to my shared experiences with my friends. Interviviing would help me and my friends prepare for the tough interview questions. I hope that I will confidently tackle interviews.

## Problem to solve

As a fellow dog lover, I totally understand the struggle of finding dog-friendly restaurants using Google's search services alone. Those scattered online directories like BringFido.com and sifting through pet-friendly tags on Yelp can feel like a bit of a hassle! But fear not! With a handy solution like Doogie, dog owners can breeze through the process and easily sniff out restaurants where they can enjoy a meal with their furry companions. Happy dining! <br>
